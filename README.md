A basic application to track your phone.

Please change things like server names, credentials, accesskeys, etc. in all three files : "map.html", "app.py", "server.py" accordingly before trying this.

Instructions:-

1) Open "map.html" from the templates folder in a browser.
2) Run "app.py" on one terminal. This file fetches data from the MQTT cloud whenever there is an update.
3) Run "server.py" on another terminal. This file updates the map with new location.
